## Project Dog Breed classifier DeepLearning-ND-Udacity
This the second project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree programm at Udacity.
The aim is to create a set of algorithms, including a neural network for the purpose of image classification. The main tasks are:
1) Ability to distinguish between a human and a dog 
2) Correct classification of the dog breed, if a dog has been detected on the picture
